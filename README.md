# 📘 PostgreSQL Fundamentals

Some essential PostgreSQL concepts, including practical examples to help deepen your understanding.

## 🧠  What is PostgreSQL?

**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). It extends the SQL language with many features like:

* Complex queries
* Foreign keys
* Triggers
* Updatable views
* Transactions
* Multiversion Concurrency Control 

It is known for reliability, feature robustness, and performance, making it a popular choice for data warehousing, web applications, and analytics systems.

## 🧠 What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?

A **schema** in PostgreSQL is a namespace that contains named database objects such as tables, views, indexes, data types, functions, and operators.

### Purpose:

* **Organization**: Helps group related database objects.
* **Access Control**: Permissions can be set on schemas independently.
* **Name Conflict Avoidance**: Same object name can exist in different schemas.

> Example:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA wildlife;
CREATE TABLE wildlife.animals (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

## 🔑 . Explain the Primary Key and  Foreign Key Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.

### **Primary Key**

A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULLs.

> Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### **Foreign Key**

A foreign key creates a relationship between two tables. It enforces referential integrity by ensuring the value in one table must exist in another.

> Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  enrollment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INT REFERENCES students(student_id),
  course_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

## 🗂️. Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations.

The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It is used in combination with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

> Example:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### Usefulness:

* Helps perform calculations on subsets of data.
* Allows summarizing information by a particular field (e.g., sales per region).

---

## 📊. How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG() in PostgreSQL?

Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value.

### Common Aggregates:

* **COUNT()**: Returns number of rows.
* **SUM()**: Adds up numeric values.
* **AVG()**: Computes average of values.

> Example:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
  SUM(price) AS total_sales,
  AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM orders;
```

These functions are especially powerful when combined with `GROUP BY` to analyze grouped data.
